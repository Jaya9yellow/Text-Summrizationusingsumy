# Extractive Text Summarization using Sumy

This repository contains a Python script for performing extractive summarization using the Sumy library. Extractive summarization involves selecting and condensing important information from a given text. In this script, we use the LexRank algorithm provided by Sumy to generate an extractive summary.

## Installation

Before running the script, make sure to install the necessary libraries. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
pip install sumy nltk
```
